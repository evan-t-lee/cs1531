# Reflection

## 1: Development Challenges
Iteration 1 was not easy. We have had to face many challenges that we didn't expect.
There are a few main aspects that when reflected upon which are major obstacles

### Stubs and Testing
During the development phase, we have had a lot of confusion on what is needed to be accomplished for testing. Many of us did work that belongs in the second iteration. Not only that, we thought that the tests needed to pass in order to be complete, however, it is not a requirement for this iteration at all. This delayed and slowed our progress, but it did not completely stop our progress. 
We tackled this problem by having a small group meeting within our labs. In the meeting, we disucssed on the ways we can do to make sure our work will be as clear as possible. As such, we have come up with a document detailing our coding style and naming style for the entire project. This ensured us that we can understand each other with comments and commits.

### Establishing priorities
In order to improve the time management of group members, it was recommended to focus on the test which was worth the most then to work on the documentation. This worked out to be quite effective as writing the test happened to be the most time consuming part of the iteration.

## 2: Team Reflection
Our team consist of 4 people, each with our own strengths and weaknesses. As iteration 1 started, we had to only solve 1 major problem. However, we encounter problems that we had to solve in order to work smoothly.

### Work distribution
We thought that this was the only problem we had to sovle as a group. It was quite simple, since there are a total of 32 functions. We decided to assign each person to 8 functions. With the understanding of the functions, each member should have there own tests and user stories. Additional documentation was distributed was done by each member writing their ideas down and relating it to an allocated person. This person would then compile the ideas in a readable format and submit it to github. The extra documentation split up to be assumptions, reflections, plans and formatting and reorganising the todo board on github. 

### Time management
Limited communication between group member has limited the efficiency of the group. Members were unaware of what exactly was necessary; including quality of test, methods to approach documentation and expectations of work turnover. This is due to the limited synchronous meetings that were held with group members.  Only 2 group calls were made and the face to face contact was limited to the tutorial. 
The reason our meetings were so limited was due to the differences in our schedules.  Some member have commitments outside of uni and classes at differing times which limited our availabilities to meet face to face.  This was solved by using online voice communication (discord) and setting meetings outside normal hours (9pm or later). However, despite this some members were unable to make it due to a lack of wifi. Meeting synchronously will be preferable over the course of this project.

### Resolving disagreement
Any disagreements between members were generally resolved by a group consensus. If there were two conflicting views, the team would have an informal vote where members generally said they sided with one member or they were indifferent after which the solution with the most votes was the decision that was followed.  There were no deadlocks in the first iteration allowing the project to run quite coherently.

## 3: Future Challenges
After working on iteration 1, I have learned a couple of things which I hope to better tackle in the future for the next iterations. One of these include better scheduling/time management and distribution of workload which could be done through earlier and more frequent meetings. Another thing I hope to improve is to be more punctual and allow more leeway for when complication arise/things do not go as planned which could be overcome through better communication and more diligent with deadlines.
